Algorithm restructure(x):

	Input: A position x of a binary search tree T that has both a parent y and a grandparent z
	Output: Tree T after a trinode restructuring. (Single or double rotation) involving positions
	        x, y, and z
	        
	a,b,c <- inorder listing of x,y,z
	T1,T2,T3,T4 <- inorder listing of the subtrees of x,y,z not rooted at x,y,or z
	Replace the subtree at z with a new subtree root at b
	a  <- left(b) 
	T1 <- left(a)
	T2 <- left(b) 
	c  <- right(b)
	T3 <- left(c)
	T4 <- right(c)
